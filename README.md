### Objectives of this repository

* Ease golang learning by associating golang-specific *concepts* with previously known concepts in the OOP field.

* ***Promote golang usage*** by easing language understanding for people coming from a heavy OOP background

## Golang Concepts
Golang introduces words with a new golang-specific meaning, such as *struct* and *interface*.
This is not bad, but sometimes it is nice to have a "translation" available to be able to understand golang-concepts by relating them to previously known concepts.

This is important in order to *understand* concepts of a new language.
If you can *translate* a golang-word to previously known concepts,
the learning is by far easier.
